This is the source code and required files.
The WebGL-Coursework.html file contains the functionality
required for requirements 1-9 and will need to be run on
a localhost server as it involves external files.
The flappybird.html file is for requirement 10 and must
be run separately. It needn't be run on a localhost
server as it does not make use of external files.
To play flappybird, press 'space' to 'flap' up
and down to avoid the moving pipes.
