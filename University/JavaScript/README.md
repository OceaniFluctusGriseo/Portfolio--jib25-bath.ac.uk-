Here is an academic project using JavaScript embedded within html to display and manipulate a cube and a camera viewing that cube within a 3D space.
I hope that this code illustrates my understanding of key programming concepts within JavaScript. The ...coursework.html file contains the code.
If you wish to run the webpage, you must run it from localhost in order to access the assets, such as the images, but this is not 100% necessary.
The report contains images of use that you may browse.
