In this folder is an example Java program I worked on, in which we created a chat server.
It contains two source programs: one for the client and run for the server and
utilises threads and sockets to function.
Within the "With GUI" folder is a version that implements a basic UI for the chat server.
The IDE I used for these projects was IDEA.
