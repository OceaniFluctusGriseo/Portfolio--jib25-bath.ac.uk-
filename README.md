# Portfolio--jib25-bath.ac.uk-
A collection of academic and personal projects

Included within this repository are examples of projects I have worked on both personal and academic.
Unfortunately, I will not have access to all of my academic projects (which are 90% C#) as they are
kept for safe keeping on the school system in which they were made, which I no longer have access to, 
so I will include what I can.

I am familiar with many concepts of C#:
Threading, Classes, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Various data structures (enums, etc.), etc.
I have also used Winforms to make an RPG like game, which very irritatingly I cannot
access because of exam security and no longer being at school. It is an oversight on my behalf
to not take a version home.

I cannot stress my skills in C# enough, having programmed in it for over 5 years. It is most
upsetting that I cannot show you any non-trivial examples.

Yours,
Joshua Brown
