# Portfolio--jib25-bath.ac.uk-
A collection of academic and personal projects

Included within this repository are examples of projects I have worked on both personal and academic.
Unfortunately, I will not have access to all of my academic projects as they are
kept for safe keeping on the school system in which they were made, which I no longer have access to, 
so I will include what I can.

There are some Java examples: e.g. a client-server based chat program with two versions: one with a basic GUI and the other
without (being purely cmd based). I used my knowledge from my networking module to assist me with this project.

I am familiar with many concepts of C#:
Threading, Classes, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Various data structures (enums, etc.), etc.
I have also used Winforms to make an RPG like game, which very irritatingly I cannot
access because of exam security and no longer being at school. It is an oversight on my behalf
to not take a version home.

I cannot stress my skills in C# and Java enough, having programmed in C# for over 5 years and Java for just over 2.

Yours,
Joshua Brown
