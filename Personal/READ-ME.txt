Here is an example of a personal project I am rather proud of.
Within the html file, is a javascript program, which is a very crass
version of the popular game 'FlappyBird'. The game will work with all
three files in the folder.

It implements 3D graphics using Three.js modules and semi-realistic
gravity physics, all of which I had to teach myself.

To play the game, press SPACE to flap, and dodge to obstacles,
the score is shown as a pop-up at the end.
